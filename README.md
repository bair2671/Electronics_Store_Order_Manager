# Electronics_Store_Order_Manager
Order management application

The Electronics Store Order Manager application is designed for order management in the case of an electronic products store. It is intended to be used by
the store operators, those who ship the products to the operators, and those who manage the stocks. 

The operator is the one who places orders at customer request. He views the list of all products left in stock, together with the related prices and existing stocks.
He can order one or more products. After any valid order, the products included in it are removed from stock, and the stock administrator and the operators logged in to
the application will see the updated list of products left in stock, respectively of stocks. The order reaches the order administrator who will send the ordered 
products to the operator. The operator will be informed that the products have been sent and he will have to confirm their reception, and then that the customer 
picked them up.

The stock administrator can add new products to the application, update or withdraw product stocks from the application. After any change, all operators logged in to the
application will see the updated list of products left in stock.

This application is developed using Spring Framework and Hibernate.
